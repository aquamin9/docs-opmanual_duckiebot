## How to charge a `DB21` {#howto-db21-charge status=ready}

To charge your Duckiebot, follow these steps:

1. Plug in the charging cable to the spare microUSB port on the `HUT`.

Note: to minimize mechanical stress on the `HUT` we recommend plugging in the charging cable once, and leaving the USB port end free to plug and unplug from charging. You can arrange the cable under the `DB21` top plate during operations for cable management.

2. Plug in the charger to a 5V 2A source (higher amperage will not be a problem, wrong voltage will send the battery to [protection mode](#db-opmanual-preliminaries-battery-protection))

3.
